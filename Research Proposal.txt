Topic Proposal, 5% (Due: Oct 24 Saturday end-of-day) 
Each team submit one proposal on Blackboard, in 150-200 words describe a) the research topic, b) the SMART question(s) of your research (you can still change them afterwards), c) the source of your data set(s) and how many (roughly) observations, and d) the link to your team's GitHub repo.




The research topic will focus on the CO2 emissions as the dependent variable.  We will be looking at how engine size, and fuel consumption affect CO2 emission.  

What are the relationships between CO2 emissions and vehicle characteristics? 
The dataset has roughly 7300 observations, which include the make, model, vehicle class, engine size, cylinders, transmission, fuel type, fuel consumption and CO2 Emissions.
